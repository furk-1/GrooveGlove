AS OF JANUARY 2024 AND UNTIL MAY 2024 THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. 

JANUARY 16th. 
  Battery level indicator (swift program) status - 
    - it works.
    - Swift program is perfectly capable of reading characteristics from and writing to the bluetooth connection, next up is to make it work in windows (I think C++?) and also figure out upper bound on how many characteristics can be written to (program to firmware) without increasing latency of HID
  
  Desktop app
    - Umm currently written in python
    - EXTREMELY low level and kinda bad, next up is to figure out list of alternatives for developing the app that isn't in python
  
  Firmware 
    - Come back and update when semester starts
